About the project:
## Inspiration
Our inspiration stems from a desire to fill existing gaps in the world of raffle, providing users with a transparent, fair, and trustworthy lottery experience. By harnessing the transparency and reliability features offered by blockchain technology, we aim to instill confidence in participants throughout the entire lottery process.

## What it does
Our project strives to implement a completely transparent and fair lottery system, utilizing cutting-edge blockchain technologies such as Chainlink VRF. Participants can enter prize draws based on point values determined by their profile attributes. These values act as a safeguard against bot accounts, taking into account criteria such as past transaction volume and balance. The lottery results, executed on the EVM, are determined by reliable random numbers generated by Chainlink VRF.

## How we built it
To build our project, we integrated blockchain technologies like Chainlink VRF, and Avalanche. We developed smart contracts on the EVM to manage the lottery process. The Graph is employed to monitor and assess participant profiles, while Chainlink VRF ensures the generation of trustworthy random numbers.

## Challenges we ran into
Throughout the development process, we faced technical challenges, especially in integrating different blockchain technologies and ensuring their smooth operation. However, we devised solutions to overcome these challenges and successfully completed our project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing our project and providing users with a reliable raffle experience are accomplishments we take pride in. We are also proud of our ability to participate in various rewards simultaneously by using leading projects like The Graph, Avalanche, and Chainlink.

## What we learned
During our project, we gained valuable insights into how blockchain technology can be utilized in raffle systems. Additionally, we acquired experience in bringing together and integrating various blockchain projects.

## What's next for Lotto
Our plans involve continuous improvement of the Lotto project to enhance the user experience. Furthermore  we will continue our efforts distributing products like NFTs , FTs(USDT,ETH,LINK etc)  integrating our project into the Web3 ecosystem.
